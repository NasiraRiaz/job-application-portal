# Mini Job Application Portal

This is a responsive web application built with React and Bootstrap that simulates a basic internship/job application form. It was created as a submission for a frontend development task.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The form is fully responsive and works on all screen sizes, thanks to the Bootstrap 5 grid system.
- **Complete Form Fields**: Includes all required fields like Full Name, Email, CNIC, Education Level (Dropdown), Skills (Checkboxes), and a Preferred Role (Dropdown).
- **Rich Form Validation**: Provides real-time feedback to the user for invalid inputs to ensure data quality.
- **Drag-and-Drop File Upload**: A user-friendly component for CV uploads (simulated).
- **Profile Completion Progress Bar**: A bonus feature that visually tracks how much of the form has been filled out.
- **Application Summary Modal**: A bonus feature where a modal pops up upon successful submission showing all the entered details.
- **Reset Functionality**: A reset button to easily clear all form fields.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Built with functional components and modern Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`).
- **Bootstrap 5**: Styled using `react-bootstrap` for a clean, responsive layout.
- **React-Dropzone**: For the drag-and-drop file upload functionality.
- **Git & GitHub**: For version control and submission.
